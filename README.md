# ⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️
_This repository is currently under development, and more exercises and examples will be added regularly. Stay tuned for updates!_


This repository contains practical examples from the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Additionally, it includes exercises based on OpenAI GYMnasium. The code in this repository is designed to be easy to understand and modify. However, it is important to note that in some cases, there may be more efficient or optimized solutions to the exercises.

## Usage
To run the code, first of all, clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/meskoj/Reinforcement-Learning.git
```
Then, it is possible to select the exercise and run it using python.

## About the Book
"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto is a comprehensive guide to the field of reinforcement learning. The book covers a wide range of topics, including dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference learning, function approximation, and more. It is considered an essential resource for anyone interested in learning and applying RL.

## Acknowledgments
This repository is inspired by and based on the examples from "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. I extend my gratitude to the authors for their seminal work in the field of reinforcement learning.
A special thanks also to Farama Foundation for mantaining the projects in GYMnasium
