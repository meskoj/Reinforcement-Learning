# Reinforcement Learning 
This repository contains practical examples from the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

## About the Book
"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto is a comprehensive guide to the field of reinforcement learning. The book covers a wide range of topics, including dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference learning, function approximation, and more. It is considered an essential resource for anyone interested in learning and applying RL.

## Usage
To run the code, first of all, clone the repository.
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/meskoj/Reinforcement-Learning.git
'''
Then, it is possible to select the exercise and run it using python.

## Acknowledgments
This repository is inspired by and based on the examples from "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. I extend my gratitude to the authors for their seminal work in the field of reinforcement learning.
